##Quickstart:
_Unless you are on a Linux computer, you are very unlikely to want to work with these files. Go to http://willpearse.github.io/phyloGenerator/install.html for detailed instructions._

* Mac: Download the pre-packaged release (http://willpearse.github.io/phyloGenerator/install.html). Open Terminal, run the file 'phyloGenerator.app/Contents/MacOS/phyloGenerator' - note that double clicking 'phyloGenerator.app' will cause an error! For example, if I'd installed phyloGenerator into my home directory, I'd type '/Users/will/phyloGenerator.app/Contents/MacOS/phyloGenerator'.
* PC: Download the pre-packaged release (http://willpearse.github.io/phyloGenerator/install.html). Either double-click 'phyloGenerator.exe', or open up command prompt, change directory (cd) into the 'phyloGenerator' directory and type 'phyloGenerator.exe' (I recommend this way).
* Linux: Instructions are http://willpearse.github.io/phyloGenerator/install.html. In brief, download the source code (https://github.com/willpearse/phyloGenerator/archive/master.zip), open Terminal, and then run 'setupLinx.py'. Follow the instructions. Once successfully setup, to run just type 'python phyloGenerator.py'.

##Examples:
There should be a 'Demos' folder with your distribution - if not, *please email me*. Inside each folder there's either a file called 'demo.txt' or 'demo.sh' - open whichever one you have. Have a look at 'Silwood_Plants' first. There are walkthrough videos online (http://willpearse.github.io/phyloGenerator/guide.html#screencasts).

##Questions:
Please feel free to drop me an email, or put any feature requests/bugs online at https://github.com/willpearse/phyloGenerator/issues.
If you're a PC or Mac person, please please please try to use the pre-compiled versions of this available on the main website. You'll have a lot more fun, I promise!
